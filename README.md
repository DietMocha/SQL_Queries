After taking a Data Science Immersive at General Assembly; where I focused on Python3 coding. I am brushing up on my SQL code to make sure there are no gaps before I study more advanced material.

For this I am taking this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/sql-for-newbs/learn/v4/t/lecture/1969226?start=0) which was suggested by my instructor. I am using sample data tables, Sakila Db, that are provided by Udemy.
